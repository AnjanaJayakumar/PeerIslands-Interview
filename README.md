# PeerIslands Interview

## Introduction
This repository consists of the solutions for the questions asked as a part of the PeerIslands technical round. Let me start by saying that I am a Machine Learning Engineer who predominantly uses Python as the programming language. Hence, my skill in Java is a bit rusty at the moment. In any case, I have implemented the solutions both in Java and Python. The Java solution is present in `Java_Solution` folder and the Python solution is present in `Python_Solution`. Each folder consists of its own `README.md` file consisting of instructions, analysis, etc. needed for running the program. Please go through them before execution.

## Thank you

Thank you for the wonderful opportunity to work on this beautiful yet challenging problem statement. The solution implemented here is just a simple solution. Most SQLParsing techniques use some type of trees to construct a query tree which is pruned and optimized to generate the final query string. However, due to the time constraint, I was not able to implement such a arduous solution and went ahead with a simpler solution. I thank you for considering my application and am eager to discuss all my solutions with peerIslands via the Interview Process. Thank you.
